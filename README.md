# Pomodoro-timer-with-python
Project was made for a college project.
This Pomodoro timer application, built using Python's tkinter for the user interface and pygame for audio playback, helps users manage their work and break intervals. It includes features for starting work or break timers, resetting the timer, and playing a sound upon completion. The timer runs in real-time, with alerts to notify the user when the session ends.
